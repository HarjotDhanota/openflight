"""Array and geometry calibration for the IWR6843 elevation array.

The checked-in reference was produced with a corner reflector at three
tape-measured positions. It is a validated starting point, not a universal
factory calibration. Conventions:

- Element corrections apply AFTER the physical-orientation flip (x8[::-1]).
- ``tilt_rad`` rotates measured angles into ground coordinates.
- ``range_bias_m`` subtracts from measured range (radar-face referenced).

Re-run array calibration whenever the board, enclosure, or antenna orientation
changes, and measure installation geometry whenever the mount moves.
